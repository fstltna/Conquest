- PROTOCOL

  - ships

    - look into 'dead reckoning' for client display of ship motion.

    - look at some way of allowing triangulation of cloaked ships,
      like in the pre client/se3rver days.  The trick is to be able to
      do this without out making it possible to cheat by modifying the
      client.

    - add a Z component for the future?

  - support downloading of textures from server?

  - meta

    - detect/highlight closed/private servers.  make 'dimmer' sorted
      last? 


- COMMON BLOCK

  - ships

    add a Z component for the future for objects (ships/planets/etc)?

  - come up with some way to export/import CB data into a text file
    for backup, exchange to other machines/architectures, and to
    facilitate upgrading of an existing CB to a new one without
    losing much (any?) data.  Maybe JSON format?


- GENERAL

  - local ship movement computation?  Big/trickey job. would require
    protocol change.

    - how to handle/sync orbiting, tow, etc...

  - observer support?  Can see viewer view only (no hud).

  - enable/disable client recording from within the game

  - allow user to go to the meta list from within the game (without
    restarting with the -m flag).

    - maybe if conquest was run with '-m', then when the users quits
      from the main menu, you go back to the meta list?  


- IP restrictions?


- OpenGL

  - bigger messages area.

  - indicate team war stat below icon?  Use 'team' icons?

- Blue Sky

  - different game types:

    - classic (like it is now)

    - deathmatch - free for all, or team.  

    - Capture The Planet :)

  - wormholes, moving, stationary, uni or bidirectional?  Implemented
    as a special type of planet?
